# Notes Scripts

This is something to ideally help with the patterns of daily notes I take. Hopefully it is helpful in some way for you as well.

### TODO
* [ ] open files in preferred application
  - [ ] could be defined in dotenv
* [ ] copy unresolved asks from last standup => into today's "daily"
* [ ] copy unresolved todos from last daily => into today's "daily"
* [ ] add dotenv and environment variables for tags, folders, etc.
* [ ] check for files first before writing them
* [ ] add "init" script (create folders, etc.)
* [ ] other useful metadata (could be useful for searching maybe?)

### Known issues
* This probably only works on mac. Not sure about other *nix systems.
